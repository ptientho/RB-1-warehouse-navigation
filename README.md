# Autonomous Shelf Detection in a Mobile Robot using the Behavior Tree

This project is to develop a complex behavior based on multiple simpler behaviors using the behavior tree.
The behavior consists of 

1. detect a shelf anywhere in the warehouse
2. get underneath the shelf and use the elevator to pick it up
3. place the shelf at a desired location

Thanks to the [BT.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/tree/master) and [BehaviorTree.ROS2](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS2) libraries, the complex behavior can be achieved.
This project is based on ROS2 Humble middleware.
